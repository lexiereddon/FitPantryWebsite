								<p>This book looks at how AI and machine learning are used in precision health with application in personalized nutrition. The chapters look into how the use of AI is tailored to health recommendations, nutrition, and dietary characteristics. This book offers great insights into building AI models for personalized health applications, which is relevant to developing an AI-powered nutrition and fitness assistant. </p>

								<p>This article shows the complexity of nutrition data,  which makes machine learning a good tool for analysis. Although ML has been used to address issues like obesity and malnutrition many researchers lack expertise in ML which limit the use of broader application. To close the gap the article provides a guide for nutrition researchers on how to use ML in their work. It explains ML fundamentals and distinguishes them from traditional  methods. Also gives examples of ML in nutrition research.</p>

								<h2>Project Description</h2>
								<blockquote>FitPantry is a nutrition and fitness application designed to help users make healthy lifestyle choices by tracking and generating custom meal plans and workout routines. Our goal is to simplify nutrition by generating meals that not only conform to a user’s dietary needs but also use the foods a user has available to them. Users can also generate workout routines and track their fitness journey so they can view their progress.
									Our application aims to assist all individuals who desire any level of assistance in their fitness journey. From fitness enthusiasts to people who know very little about nutrition, FitPantry can help users save time by managing dietary restrictions, fitness goals, and specific nutritional needs.
									The main capabilities of our application revolve around personalizing the fitness and nutrition experience. To accomplish this, users can set their own goals and restrictions such as basic biometric information and allergies as well as their own fitness goals such as losing weight or gaining muscle. Users can also add foods to their pantry that will be used to generate nutritious customized meals that conform to their goals. Workouts are also tailored to everyone by recommending exercises that would help them achieve their goals based on their information. Additionally, the app will allow users to “favorite” the exercises and meals they prefer. This data will be used to create shopping lists so they can continue to cook their favorite meals.
									FitPantry is currently being developed for use on iOS devices exclusively. Given that we are using Xcode as our IDE and Swift as our programming language for the interface. Our backend is being managed by Firebase for storing data and user authentication. AI components are being implemented with PyTorch using the Python language for training. </blockquote>
